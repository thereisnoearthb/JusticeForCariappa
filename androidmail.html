<p><strong>Subject </strong>: To ensure justice for Cariappa from the Jenu Kuruba tribe<br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>I wanted to bring to your attention the case of Cariappa, a resident of H.D Kote, Karnataka, and member of the Jenu Kuruba tribe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was forcefully taken by Gundre division Forest Department officials on 10 October 2022, after which he was brutally beaten and harassed, succumbing to his injuries on 13 October 2022.</p>
<p>The forest officials accuse Cariappa of selling deer meat, and claim he died of a heart attack, but photos taken by the tribe members when they visited him show bruises on his body. Although a complaint has been filed by Cariappa&rsquo;s son against the 17 forest officials who were involved in this, no action has been taken against them so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jenu Kuruba have long faced denial of their forest rights, and have continually faced harassment at the hands of the forest department. I stand in solidarity with their immediate demands to bring justice for Cariappa and his family, and appeal to you to take immediate action on the same.</p>
<p>The demands include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the forest officials involved in custodial violence and death of Cariappa are removed from their position of power and a fair trial and appropriate legal action to be taken against them.</li>
<li>The affected family get the requisite compensation and relief package that they deserve</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this, I also stand in solidarity with the larger demands of the Jenu Kuruba for the recognition of their community and habitation rights in the forests of Nagarahole. A complete halt must be brought to the ongoing eviction of the Jenu Kuruba people and they must be allowed to freely practise all their cultural and social traditions in the forest. Indigenous people are custodians of our forests, and conservation must work to amplify their way of life and not crush it completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am confident that you will take appropriate action to ensure justice is brought to Cariappa&rsquo;s family, and to the Jenu Kruba people of Nagarahole.</p>
<p>In Solidarity,</p>
<p>A concerned citizen</p>
      </main>
